2. Copy the specific sound variation _(or all of them)_, that you'd like to mute in-game and put them in your **`sounds.txt`** file
3. Run the **`MuteSounds`** app
4. Move the generated **Sound** folder to **`WoW_Client\Data\enUS\`**
   
**Note**: You might have a different language folder than **`enUS`**
if so, just move the **`Sound`** folder to your language folder.
  
5. The specified sound(s) should be muted in-game

Following the example pictures, your **`sounds.txt`** file should look like this:
```
ArcaneMissileImpact1A
ArcaneMissileImpact1B
ArcaneMissileImpact1C
```
